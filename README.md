# House-Price-Prediction
#  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and more.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict housing prices using real-world data. It's a beginner-friendly regression problem and a great way to understand the basics of predictive modeling.

---

##  Features

- Preprocessing and scaling of data  
- Splitting into train and test sets  
- Model training using `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`  
- Evaluation using **Mean Squared Error** and **RÂ² Score**  
- Visualization of results (optional)

---

##  Dataset

> You can use any housing dataset such as:
- [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
- Or your custom dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.)

---

##  Libraries Used

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (optional for visualization)
